To use, put the full scramble in the clue.txt. Next, put what we
have confirmed in the whatweknow.txt file. If we don't know anything 
leave the file empty

Output will return what we know and what is left.

TO-DO:

- Add command-line arguments to specify our own files to draw input from rather
than hardcode them

- Add a guess looper mode that lets the user guess a string from an input prompt.
The program should check the string against what we have
